# HumanActivityRecognition
### This repo contains a CodeBook.md that describe the variables.
### It also contain a script named run_analysis.R that will perform the 5 steps below:
* Step 1 - Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Step 2 - Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* Step 3 - Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Step 4 - Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
* Step 5 - From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

### Inside the run_analysis.R script, you will find comments and code for performing each of the above steps.
